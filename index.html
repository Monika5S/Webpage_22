            <h2>The internet has become such an important part of everyday life that some consider it a 
                human right.  Without the internet, people would have difficulty communicating, many 
                employees could not work, and students would face more barriers to learning.  
                New technologies that leverage the internet are exploring the Internet of Things, cloud 
                gaming, artificial intelligence and 5G.  No one knows how the internet will evolve.  
                But if the past is any indication, changes will happen at lightning speed.

                 <h2> Vint Cerf, born June 23, 1943, designed the TCP/IP protocols and the internet
                    architecture with his co-designer Robert E. Kahn. Known as the “Father of the Internet”, 
                    Cerf began work at the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1973 at the request of Kahn.<br>
                    Kahn had successfully demonstrated ARPANET, a network of computers capable of intercommunications in 1972, 
                    but needed a packet-switching protocol that let computers interact regardless of their hardware configuration. 
                    That’s when he thought of Cerf. Cerf came to play a critical role in shaping today’s internet.

                    Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, 
                    while working at CERN. The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand 
                    for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes 
                    around the world.<br>
                    The basic idea of the WWW was to merge the evolving technologies of computers, data 
                    networks and hypertext into a powerful and easy to use global information system.

            <h1>Larry Roberts </h1><br>
            <h2> Using Kleinrock's theory, Roberts designed the Department of Defense's ARPANET network, which become

            <h2>Can you imagine life without email? Tomlinson is credited with sending the first email via ARPANET in 1971. Further,
                he went on to develop standards for email messages, to design ways to organize emails on a user's computer, 
                and to create tools for writing and reading emails.</h2>

                the actual TCP/IP address of every site we visited. In 1985, the first domain name was assigned.</h2>

                government-funded projects. In 1989, Shein became the first internet service provider to allow dial-up access 
                to the internet for a charge of $20 per month.</h2>
